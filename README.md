# Employee Management App

This is a web application built using React for managing employees. The app allows users to add and remove employees, assign bonuses to employees, and filter the employees based on their salary or whether they have received a bonus. By clicking on a employee's name, we indicate that the employee will receive a salary raise. Clicking on a cookie icon highlights the employee's name, indicating that they will receive a bonus. Additionally, searching for an employee in the list can be done by typing characters.

- **Add Employee**: Users can add new employees by providing their name and salary.
